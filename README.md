## Project Name: Paw-roled:

- Paw-roled is designed for pet owners, whose furry friends are up to no good!  If you, the disappointed pet-owner, want to discipline your pet for bad behavior, you can register your pet as an offender and make posts about their offenses. On our site, you can also browse the offender directory, to see all registered silly -pets. From the directory, you can click on a single offender and view all of their offenses. You can also vote for the top 3 naughtiest pets. If you feel that your pet has changed their ways, and you want give them redemption, using the redemption feature, you can make a post about them, praising and rewarding them for changing their ways. 

- This application offers a variety of functionality. Look below for all user stories.

- 1. Look at all of the posts that angry pet owners make about their naughty furry friends
- 2. Look at the current list of the top 3(maybe 5) most mis-behaved pets

## As a Authenticated User(user with an account, who verifies identity):

## Reach Goals:

- Follow other pet owners
- Unfollow accounts
- View the list of all of your followers(make an ArrayList or something an attribute for each user, so that each app user can identify all of their followers)

## Suggested Bonus Goal Idea: 

-Create your UI application using React (Can deploy using Azure App Services)

## Tools leveraged:

- We will deploy our database to Azure cloud computing services
- Our CI/CD pipeline will be created with Azure DevOps.
- We will use the Spring Data for our ORM to communicate with db. 
- We will create our user interface using React, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
