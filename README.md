# Wildcats-Pawroled

## Project Name: Paw-roled:

- This site is designed for pet owners, whose furry friends are up to no good! This application offers a variety of functionality.

## As a Non-Authenticated User(user without an account), you can:
- 1. Look at all of the posts that angry pet owners make about their naughty furry friends
- 2. Look at the current list of the top 3(maybe 5) most mis-behaved pets

## As a Authenticated User(user with an account, who verifies identity):
- 2. Make posts about their scoundrel pets, informing the world of the details of their disobedience
- 3. Vote for the top 3(maybe 5) most defiant pets, of all of the available posts
- 4. Tweet about a particularly delinquent pet directly from the site(by leveraging the twitter api and connecting accounts, what do you think? too ambitious?)
- 5. Update a post you made in the past about your scoundrel pet
- 6. Delete a post you made in the past about your furry friend, if you believe that they have changed their ways and no longer deserve online humiliation
- 7. Follow other ashamed pet owners
- 8. Unfollow accounts
- 9. View the list of all of your followers(make an ArrayList or something an attribute for each user, so that each app user can identify all of their followers)
- 10. Tweet about a particularly delinquent pet directly from the site(by leveraging the twitter api and connecting accounts, what do you think? too ambitious?)

## Suggested Bonus Goal: 

- Create your UI application using React (Can deploy using Azure App Services)
